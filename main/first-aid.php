		<h3>Assess the Situation</h3>
		<p>Ensure Safety: Check the environment for any dangers.</p>
		<p>Determine Severity: Look for signs of serious injury or illness.</p>
		<h3>Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC)</h3>
		<p>Airway: If the person is unconscious, tilt their head back slightly to open the airway. If they’re choking and conscious, encourage them to cough.</p>
		<p>Breathing: Look, listen, and feel for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If they aren’t breathing, begin CPR.</p>
		<p>Circulation: Check for a pulse. If there’s no pulse, perform chest compressions (30 compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths).</p>
		<h3>Control Bleeding</h3>
		<p>Apply direct pressure to any bleeding wounds with a clean cloth or bandage.</p>
		<p>If the bleeding doesn’t stop, add more layers without removing the first one.</p>
		<h3>Positioning</h3>
		<p>If the person is conscious and has no neck or back injury, keep them comfortable. If they’re unconscious but breathing, place them in the recovery position (on their side) to keep the airway clear.</p>
		<h3>Treating Burns</h3>
		<p>Cool the burn with running water for at least 10 minutes. Don’t apply ice directly or use ointments.</p>
		<h3>Managing Shock</h3>
		<p>Keep the person lying down and elevate their legs if there are no injuries to the legs or back. Keep them warm with a blanket.</p>
		<h3>Monitor</h3>
		<p>Keep an eye on their condition. Be ready to provide updates to the ambulance crew when they arrive.</p>
		<h3>Stay Calm and Reassure</h3>
		<p>Talk to the person calmly and reassuringly until help arrives</p>
